How it works
---
#### Crop harvest
Right-click harvests and replants the crop with (if available) a seed from the drop. If a seed is not available in the drop, it takes one from the players inventory.
It also works on cocoa.

#### Custom recipes
I have added a bunch of useful custom recipes to improve overall gameplay.
They can be found in the crafting book.
_**Chest from logs**_

You can craft 4 chests from any kind of log.

_**Melons to slices**_

You can now cut up your own melon! No more block placing and breaking to turn melons into melon slices.

You can now dye 8 carpets with a single dye.

_**Portable workbench**_

Instead of using `/gwb`, you can craft the portable workbench.

#### Crafting table
Players can use `/gwb` to change a normal crafting table to a portable one. After that a crafting table is just a right-click away.

#### Armor Switch
You can right-click to equip armor. You can't right-click to switch that equipped armor. **NO LONGER!**
 

---

#### Compass
When a player respawns, they get a compass with their location in the lore. The compass points to the location of players death. With a right-click the player resets compass back to world spawn.
